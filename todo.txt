Big feature plan
----------------
goal: 
    (1) want to make the game rewarding for staying in the game.
    (2) want to discourage old-timers from bullying newcomers and keep the game
        balanced between them
        - ideally, strong players have the potential to crush newer, weaker players,
            but are highly discouraged from doing so.
    (3) want to increase importance in tactical decision-making 

strategy:
    Projectiles for each player are now limited. 
    Shooting a projectile costs *ammo*, which must be picked up from the ground.

    We will have a *leaderboard* based on HP.
    This would make the game more interesting, competitive, and long-term.

    More HP => faster movement (a way to reward skill) and bigger projectiles
    but also => bigger player radius (easier to get hit)

    To get more HP, we have *lifesteal*. In other words, a player gets strong
    by hitting other players.

    Lifesteal, scales with hittee's HP.
    Therefore, more rewarding to hit strong players than weak players.

    Larger projectiles (from stronger players) cost more ammo.
    Stronger players would be less inclined to waste ammo on a weak player, which
        would give small lifesteal.
    This also counters the advantage that a bigger, faster, and stronger player 
    would have in obtaining ammo.

Additional:
    spawn player away from opponents
    optimize search space with quadtree
    skins
    sound
    mobile devices

Powerup ideas:
    wall, like in boxhead2d
    speed boost
    shroud of shadows - player is unseen unless within certain distance of 
        another
